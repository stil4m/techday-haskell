# Project Euler

Make some of the project Euler exercises. The idea of today is to learn Haskell, not mathematics. If you have problems with the math, you are aloud look at implementations of other languages, but I want you to try to create some nice code.

Some nice problems are:

* 1
* 2
* 3
* 6
* 16
* 20
* 7
* 18 (monad)
* 22 (monad)
* 35
* 46
